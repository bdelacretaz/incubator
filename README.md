# Apache Incubator Website

## Prerequisites

The website is built using JBake and a Groovy template.
The builds for the website do require internet access.

- Install JBake from http://jbake.org/download.html
- Create an environment variable `JBAKE_HOME` pointing to your JBake installation
- Ensure that you have a JVM locally, e.g. [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/install/)

## Clone the Source code

If you have write access to incubator, you should clone it from https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator.git
otherwise you can fork from our github mirror https://github.com/apache/incubator and raise a pull request.

## Building & Running the site locally

There is a custom `bake.sh` file that is used to build the website.
You can call it with any of the [arguments you would pass to jbake](http://jbake.org/docs/2.5.1/#bake_command).
The easiest way to use it is to run `./bake.sh -b -s`
This will start up JBake in a watching mode as you make changes it will refresh after a short period of time.
While working with it locally, you'll notice that the site URLs redirect to `incubator.apache.org`;
to change this edit `jbake.properties` and uncomment the line referencing `localhost`

## Jenkins Setup - publishing the live site

Commits to the `jbake-site` branch are automatically checked out and built using `build_site.sh`.
Once this goes live those commits will go against `master`.
The jenkins job can be found at [https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/Incubator/job/Incubator%20Site/](https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/Incubator/job/Incubator%20Site/)
The result of the commits are pushed to the `asf-site` branch which are then published using `gitwcsub`

## Asciidoctor

Most of the pages in the site are written using Asciidoctor.
While it is a form of asciidoc it does have some [syntax differences that are worth reviewing](http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/)

## Groovy Templates

The site templates are written in groovy scripts.
Even though the files end with `.gsp` they are not GSP files and do not have access to tag libraries.
You can run custom code in them, similar to what is done in [homepage.gsp](templates/homepage.gsp)
